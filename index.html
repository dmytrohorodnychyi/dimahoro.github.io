      <p>My life at university is not as exciting as you might assume.
        I spent most of the time in my flat learning programming and the material taught by the professors in my course.
        Gladly, I was also able to become the accompanist for the AberMADS choir, and I spent
        a lot of time in rehearsals helping them with my piano playing to learn
        the repertoire for their concerts.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="about-music" class="about-section">
      <p>I developed a love for music at a <em>strange</em> age.
         What I mean by <em>strange</em> is this: <strong>It was too late to enter a
          junior music school, but too early to enter a music academy (this was in Ukraine,
          and the terms 'junior music school' and 'music academy' are completely different
          from those used in the UK).
         </strong></p>
      <p>
        Anyway, here's a bit of context (also - memories) for you: "<em>One day, when I was late at school after lessons,
          I was walking past rooms I had never been in before and did not know what was in them.
          Suddenly, I heard a melody played on the piano. I had to stop and listen to see which room the sound was coming from.
          While I was figuring it out, I had to listen to a certain composition played on the piano.
          I liked the sound and the melody very much, so I headed home in a hurry.
          When I got home, I told my mum that I wanted to learn to play the piano.
          Of course, she was shocked (as she would never assume that one day I will tell her this), but she did not refuse and helped me...
          Two weeks later, on my birthday, I received a gorgeous piano as a present (it was completely out of tune, but I did not care at first).</em>"
      </p>
      <p>
        I won't go into details about how I studied at junior music school (yes, I was able to get into a junior music school) - 
        I'll just say that I was a laureate of international competitions and prizes and received the maximum scholarship for my achievementsüòÅ
        <sub>(yes, I bragged a little, so what now?)</sub>
      </p>
      <p>
        After successfully completing my course at junior music school, I decided to continue my success and enrol in a music academy...
        Unfortunately, things did not go as smoothly as I had hoped, and I failed to get into the academy.
        The problem wasn't my grades or my success - the problem was the professor who wanted to be my mentor.<br />
        Again, I won't go into too much detail: I'll just say that the new teacher at the academy was very mean, rude,
        and did not fit my personality at all (and in music, similarity in personality to your teacher or mentor is very important).
      </p>
      <p>
        After that I took a long break of 2 years from all music.
        I did not play, I did not perform, I did not teach - absolutely nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, due to certain circumstances (I wonder what kind of circumstances...ü§î), I had to leave my country
        prematurely in 2022 and seek asylum in the UK. And here, after a long 2 years of downtime, the 'resurrection'
        of my musical talent began again.<br /> During my studies at Sixth Form, my teacher noticed my talent and suggested I apply
        to study at the Birmingham Royal Conservatoire. And for personal interest, I decided to do so. Three weeks later I was invited to
        an audition, and immediately after the audition I was accepted as a student of Junior Conservatoire.<br />
        Also, I met many people who worked with different charities and when I told them about my enrolment at Birmingham Royal Conservatoire,
        they instantly asked me to perform at their fund-raising events and concerts in support of British people and Ukrainian refugees.<br />
        After 2 years of study I successfully completed my studies at the Conservatoire and received my diploma - my happiness was boundless
        as I was able to fulfill my dream: to get a musical education.<br />Alongside this, I have been performing seasonal concerts for 3 years
        for various charities and volunteer organisations to support British people and Ukrainian refugees in need.

        <p>
          This website can be considered as my first (and somewhat complete) project.
          Before that, I have started several different pet-projects, but I did not finish any of them.
          Maybe this is because of my laziness, maybe this is because of some other circumstances - who knows?
          When I start some project I always fear I do not have enough knowledge to finish it, and because of this
          I can easily drop it out and forget its existence.<br /> Hopefully, after finishing this website, I will feel more confident
          and start some other projects for my portfolio - otherwise, I will struggle to find a job later on üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è
